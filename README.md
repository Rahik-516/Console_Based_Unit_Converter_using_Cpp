# Console_Based_Unit_Converter_using_Cpp
This project is designed for those taking the Software Development Lab 1 course, where you typically need to build a console-based project using C++.

I have provided a template for the project, but I have not completed it entirely. This is to ensure you get the opportunity to learn and implement some of the features yourself. If I were to do everything, you wouldn't gain the necessary learning experience.

Here are the parts you need to implement on your own:

File I/O for the 'See Previous Conversions' Functionality: This will allow users to view their previous conversions.
Retry Function: Implement the retry function I've declared, which will enable users to return to the previous page after a conversion is made.
Once you've completed these tasks, you should be good to go. If you need any help, feel free to reach out. I'm happy to assist, but please don't ask for the entire source code. Instead, share the specific parts of your code where you're facing issues, and I can help you with those.

Contact me via LinkedIn. You can find my LinkedIn username on my GitHub profile.

Here are some screenshots of the console after running the program:
